# Green Tech Vault - Environmental Impact Tracking System Implementation Guide

This guide outlines the implementation of the Environmental Impact Tracking System for Green Tech Vault, which tracks and showcases the environmental impact of e-waste management efforts.

## Project Structure

We've created a full-stack web application with the following components:

### Backend (Node.js/Express/MongoDB)

- **Models**: Database schemas for Companies, Devices, Pickups, Reports, and Users
- **Controllers**: Business logic for handling API requests
- **Routes**: API endpoints for accessing and manipulating data
- **Utilities**: Helper functions for environmental impact calculations

### Frontend (React)

- A client-side React application for displaying environmental impact data
- Dashboard for visualizing impact metrics
- Company profiles showing contributions
- Report generation and viewing

## Environmental Impact Metrics

The system uses industry-standard benchmarks to calculate environmental impacts:

### Carbon Emission Factors

- Device-specific CO2 footprints for new manufacturing
- Refurbishment savings (70-80% of new device footprint)
- Recycling savings (1.2-1.6 kg CO2 per kg of e-waste)

### Material Recovery Rates

- Device-specific material composition estimates
- Tracking of metals, plastics, glass, and rare earth metals recovered

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Backend Setup (Completed)

- [x] Set up Node.js/Express server
- [x] Configure MongoDB connection
- [x] Create data models (Company, Device, Pickup, Report, User)
- [x] Implement environmental impact calculation utilities
- [x] Create API routes and controllers

### 2. Frontend Development (To Be Completed)

- [ ] Set up React application with routing
- [ ] Create dashboard components for visualizing impact data
- [ ] Implement company profile pages
- [ ] Build report generation and viewing interfaces
- [ ] Design responsive UI with modern styling

### 3. Authentication and Authorization (To Be Completed)

- [ ] Implement user authentication with JWT
- [ ] Set up role-based access control
- [ ] Create login/registration forms
- [ ] Secure API endpoints

### 4. Report Generation (To Be Completed)

- [ ] Implement PDF report generation
- [ ] Create email notification system for new reports
- [ ] Design report templates with company branding

### 5. Data Visualization (To Be Completed)

- [ ] Implement charts and graphs for impact metrics
- [ ] Create comparative visualizations (e.g., trees planted, cars removed)
- [ ] Design timeline views for tracking progress

2. Implement authentication and authorization
3. Create PDF report generation functionality
4. Design and implement data visualization components
5. Set up automated testing
6. Deploy the application to a production environment

## Conclusion

This Environmental Impact Tracking System will enable Green Tech Vault to:

1. Track and showcase the environmental impact of e-waste management efforts
2. Provide detailed reports to client companies
3. Visualize the positive effects of reducing e-waste in landfills
4. Demonstrate the recovery of valuable materials from e-waste

By implementing this system, Green Tech Vault will be able to quantify and communicate the environmental benefits of their work, helping to promote sustainable e-waste management practices.
