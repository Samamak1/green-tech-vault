## Next Steps

For the site to display correctly, you need to:

1. **Replace the placeholder images with real images**:
   - Put the CEO headshot at: `client/public/images/leila-meyer.jpg`
   - Put the stock chart background at: `client/public/images/stock-chart.jpg` 

2. **Run the verification tool**:
   ```
   node verify-images.js
   ```

3. **Rebuild the application**:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

After these steps, the site should display exactly as designed with all the requested features.
