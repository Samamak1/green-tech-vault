# Deployment Notes - Image Issues & Workarounds

## Issues Identified

When deploying to Render, we encountered issues with image loading:

1. **Image references not resolving**: Files like robot-logo.svg, leila-meyer.jpg, and stock-chart.jpg were not loading properly.

2. **Build process limitations**: The build process wasn't copying the images correctly or the files weren't being uploaded to the repository.

## Workarounds Implemented

Instead of relying on external image files, we've implemented the following workarounds:

### 1. Robot Logo in Header
- Replaced the image reference with an inline SVG directly in the BrandedHeader component
- The logo is now orange (#FF8C00) with white features
- This ensures it appears correctly without any external file dependencies

### 2. CEO Profile Images - UPDATED
- Now using the actual profile image of Leila Meyer
- File should be placed at: `/client/public/images/leila-meyer.jpg`
- Updated both the CEO Profile page and About Us page to use this image
- The build process has been enhanced to check for and copy this file properly
- Title has been updated to "CEO" (without the "Architect LEED AP" suffix)
- Bio text has been updated with the new description

### 3. Parallax Background
- Replaced the stock chart image with a gradient background
- Used a blue gradient (`linear-gradient(135deg, #1e3c72 0%, #2a5298 100%)`)
- Applied the same teal overlay for consistency
- The parallax effect still works with the gradient

### 4. Footer Color
- Verified the footer color is correctly set to #073C3F
- Added console logging to confirm the color value is being used

## Future Improvements

If you wish to revert to using actual images for the remaining placeholders:

1. Upload the actual image files to the correct locations:
   - `/client/public/images/robot-logo.svg`
   - `/client/public/images/stock-chart.jpg`

2. Update the code to reference these files again:
   - BrandedHeader.js: Change back to using the image reference
   - NewLandingPage.js: Update the ParallaxSection to use the background image

## Verification

To verify the changes are working:
1. Look for the inline SVG robot logo in the header
2. Check that the CEO profile shows the actual profile image
3. Verify the gradient appears in the "We Take Pride In Our Numbers" section
4. Confirm the footer is the correct dark teal color (#073C3F)
