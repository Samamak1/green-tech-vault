# Join Us Page Styling Updates - Summary of Changes

## Changes Made to RecyclingOffersPage.js

### üî≥ White Box Styling (Hero Section)

#### Opacity Adjustment:
- **Changed from:** `backgroundColor: 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.4)'`
- **Changed to:** `backgroundColor: 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.6)'`
- **Result:** Increased opacity by 20% (from 40% to 60%) making the white box more opaque

#### Vertical Extension:
- **Added:** `paddingTop: theme.spacing(8)` - Increased top padding to extend box upward
- **Added:** `marginTop: 0` - Ensures box starts from the very top
- **Changed:** Container `pt: 8` to `pt: 0` - Removed top padding so white box touches header
- **Result:** White box now extends upward to touch the site header, matching the How It Works page

### üñºÔ∏è Image & Text Section Adjustments

#### Movement Section (Hands Image):
- **Image Container:**
  - Changed `maxWidth` from `300` to `350`
  - Added `maxHeight: 280` with `objectFit: 'cover'`
  - Added responsive breakpoints for mobile devices
- **Layout:**
  - Added `alignItems="stretch"` to Grid container for equal height
  - Added flexbox styling to text column for vertical centering
  - Added responsive margin adjustments

#### Recycling Made Accessible Section:
- **Image Container:**
  - Set `maxWidth: 400` to constrain image size
  - Added `maxHeight: 320` with `objectFit: 'cover'`
  - Added responsive breakpoints for mobile devices
- **Layout:**
  - Changed from `alignItems="center"` to `alignItems="stretch"`
  - Added flexbox styling to text column for vertical centering
  - Wrapped image in responsive container

### üõ†Ô∏è Responsive Considerations:
- **Desktop:** Images constrained to specific max dimensions with height limits
- **Tablet:** Images scale to 100% width with adjusted margins
- **Mobile:** Height constraints removed, images stack vertically with preserved spacing
