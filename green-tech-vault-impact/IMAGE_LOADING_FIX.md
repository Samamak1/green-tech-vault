# Image Loading Issue Fixes

The site is currently experiencing issues with certain images not loading properly. Here's how to fix these issues:

## Required Images

The following images need to be properly uploaded with real content (not placeholders):

1. **CEO Portrait (Leila Meyer)**
   - Path: `client/public/images/leila-meyer.jpg`
   - Current status: Placeholder (1 byte)
   - Fix: Replace with the actual CEO image you've attached

2. **Stock Chart Background** 
   - Path: `client/public/images/stock-chart.jpg`
   - Current status: Placeholder (1 byte)
   - Fix: Replace with the stock chart image you've attached

3. **Robot Logo**
   - Path: `client/public/images/robot-logo.svg`
   - Current status: Ok (712 bytes)
   - Note: This file exists but may not be loading correctly

## Steps to Fix

1. **Upload the Real Images:**
   - Replace the placeholder files with the real images you've attached
   - Make sure to use the exact same filenames for compatibility

2. **Verify the Images:**
   - Run `node verify-images.js` to check if the images are now valid
   - All images should show a proper file size (more than 100 bytes)

3. **Test Locally:**
   - Run `npm run dev` to test the site locally
   - Verify that all images appear correctly

4. **Rebuild for Deployment:**
   - Run `npm run build` to create a production build
   - Verify that images are copied to the build directory

## Parallax Background Issue

For the parallax background effect with the stock chart image:

1. Make sure the stock-chart.jpg file is a real image
2. The image should be high resolution (at least 1920px wide)
3. CSS in NewLandingPage.js is set up correctly with:
   - `background-attachment: fixed`
   - `background-position: center`
   - `background-size: cover`

## Troubleshooting

If images still don't appear after these steps:

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify file permissions (should be readable)
3. Make sure the image paths match exactly (/images/filename.ext)
4. Clear browser cache and reload
5. Check that the build process is copying files correctly
